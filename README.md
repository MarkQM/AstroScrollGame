This is the raw, unmodified code for a small game I made for an assignment for COSC102: Data Structures.  For this assignment, we were given some starter classes such as Grid, Color, and Class.  For this assignment we were given a large degree of creative leeway regarding rules, assets, etcs.  This was my favorite assignment for that class for that very reason.  It was the first time I had some 'freedom' in coding.

# Controls

Your ship will start the game on the left side of the screen.  Avoid the onslaught of enemy ships approaching from the right and keep your ship powered.  As time progresses, the game will be become gradually more difficult with more and more enemy ships spawning.  Your energy level will fall at a constant rate.  Replenish your energy with energy pick ups that will also spawn on the right.  You have a powerful energy ball weapon that clears the entire row of enemy ships but will cost you 1/3 of your CURRENT energy, so use it wisely.

Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) move your ship in that direction.  Use it to avoid colliding enemy ships, pick up energy pick-ups, and reposition yourself.

Space bar fires your weapon.  It will clear the entire row of ships ahead of you, including energy pick-ups!  Remember the weapon will spend 1/3 of your CURRENT energy.

See if you can survive to the end!

Welcome to AstroScrollGame where the frame rate is low and the points don't matter!

# Between You and Me
As you might be able to tell, there are flaws with the code organization, optimization, and documentation.  Since writing this 3 years ago, I have learned how to better organize and document my code.  Nonetheless, this particular assignment holds a special place in my heart.  Manually creating the assets for this game on Photoshop was also a blast!
